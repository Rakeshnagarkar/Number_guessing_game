This is a simple number guessing game where the player tries to guess a randomly chosen number between 1 to 100 within a limited number of attempts.

The game will welcome you and prompt you to choose a difficulty level: "easy" or "hard".

If you choose "hard", you will have 5 attempts to guess the number. If you choose "easy", you will have 10 attempts.

You will then be prompted to make a guess. Enter your guess as an integer.

The game will tell you if your guess is too high or too low.

Keep guessing until you either correctly guess the number or run out of attempts.

If you correctly guess the number, you win the game! If you run out of attempts, you lose.

You will then be prompted to play again. If you choose "yes", the game will start again with a new randomly chosen number. If you choose "no", the game will end.

Have fun playing!
